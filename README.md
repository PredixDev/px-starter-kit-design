# Starter Kit

The Predix Experience Starter Kit is one of Px's meta kits and simply ties together a few key dependencies that are usually the starting point for any new project. It is a fork of inuitcss' [starter-kit](https://github.com/inuitcss/starter-kit). The Starter Kit specifically contains Px and inuitcss default variables and mixins, as well as [Nicolas Gallagher](https://twitter.com/necolas)â€™s [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css), global `box-sizing`, viewport, and typography rules.

Additionally, the Starter Kit includes unobtrusive helper and trump classes for use within a project. This enables by default utilities to help with responsive implementation and micro spacing strategies.

## Dependencies

Strictly speaking, the Starter Kit is just a collection of dependencies and nothing else. There is no Sass file, just modules you can import into your project as a starting point.

## Installation

    $ bower install --save https://github.build.ge.com/PXd/px-starter-kit-design.git

## Usage

The modules must be imported in the following order:

    // Generic
    @import "../px-normalize-design/generic.normalize";
    @import "../px-box-sizing-design/generic.box-sizing";
    @import "../px-helpers-design/generic.helpers";
    
    // Base
    @import "../px-flexbox-design/base.flexbox";
    @import "../px-viewport-design/base.viewport";
    @import "../px-typography-design/base.typography";
    
    // Trumps
    @import "../px-clearfix-design/trumps.clearfix";
    @import "../px-spacing-responsive-design/trumps.spacing-responsive";
    @import "../px-widths-responsive-design/trumps.widths-responsive";

See [px-getting-started](https://github.build.ge.com/PXd/px-getting-started#a-note-about-relative-import-paths) for an explanation of the `../`
